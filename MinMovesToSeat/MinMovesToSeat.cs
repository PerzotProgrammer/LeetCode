        // Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
        // Output: 4
        // Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
        // - The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
        // - The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
        // - The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
        // In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

        // Example 2:
        //
        // Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
        // Output: 7
        // Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
        // - The first student is not moved.
        // - The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
        // - The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
        // - The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
        // In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.

        // Example 3:
        //
        // Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
        // Output: 4
        // Explanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
        //     The students are moved as follows:
        // - The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
        // - The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
        // - The third student is not moved.
        // - The fourth student is not moved.
        // In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.
